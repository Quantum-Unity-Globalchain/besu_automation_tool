### Key Files and Code Snippets

#### Configuration Files

- **config/endpointconfig.json**: Contains network details for XDC parentnet and subnet.
- **config/network.config.json**: Specifies RPC URLs for the parentnet and subnet.

#### Environment File

- **.env**: Holds environment variables for SSH connection, Azure Key Vault, and network RPC URLs.

#### Deployment Scripts

- **scripts/endpointdeploy.js**: Deploys the ZeroEndpoint contract.
- **scripts/registerapplication.js**: Registers a user application with the ZeroEndpoint contract.
- **scripts/registerchain.js**: Registers a new blockchain with the ZeroEndpoint contract.

#### XDCZeroConfigurator.js

Implements the setup, configuration, and deployment process for XDC Zero.

### Documentation Updates

#### README.md

Add a section on XDC Zero integration, outlining steps for environment setup, configuration, and deployment.

#### docs/USER_GUIDE.md

Include detailed instructions for configuring and deploying with XDC Zero, covering prerequisites, configuration files, and deployment steps.

#### docs/architecture.md

Describe the architecture of the XDC Zero integration, focusing on the role of configuration files, environment variables, deployment scripts, and the `XDCZeroConfigurator.js` script.

### Implementation Notes

- Ensure all placeholders in configuration files and scripts are replaced with actual data relevant to your deployment scenario.
- Test each component individually and then as a whole to ensure seamless integration and deployment.
- Update documentation as necessary to reflect any changes or additions to the project setup or deployment process.

This comprehensive listing and overview provide a clear roadmap for completing the project with the integration of XDC Zero and potentially other blockchain configurations.
