# Hyperledger Besu Automation Tool

Welcome to the Hyperledger Besu Automation Tool, a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the deployment and management of a Hyperledger Besu blockchain network. This tool simplifies the complex steps involved in setting up a blockchain network by automating configuration file generation, node key management, deployment through VS Code with Azure extensions, virtual machine setup, networking, and ongoing redeployment and monitoring.

## Features

- **Configuration File Generation**: Automatically generates genesis and node configuration files based on user input.
- **Node Key Management**: Securely manages the generation, replacement, and rotation of node keys.
- **VS Code and Azure Integration**: Facilitates deployment through VS Code using Azure extensions, including the automation of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.
- **Virtual Machine Setup**: Provides ARM templates for setting up VMs with the necessary software and configurations.
- **Networking Configuration**: Automates the setup of virtual networks, subnets, and network security groups in Azure.
- **Deployment and Monitoring**: Integrates with Azure Monitor and other tools for real-time monitoring of network health and performance.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Includes a feedback mechanism for users to report issues or request features.
